/* Flexbox positioning */

/* Step 1: body is a flex container */
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* stack header, main, footer vertically */
  height: 100vh; /* take full viewport height */
}

/* Step 2: main is also a flex container */
main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* place article and aside side by side */
  flex: auto; /* let main grow and shrink as needed */
}

/* Step 3: article takes 2/3 of the space */
article {
  flex: 2;
  overflow-y: auto; /* scroll if content is too tall */
}

/* Step 4: aside takes 1/3 of the space */
aside {
  flex: 1;
  overflow-y: auto; /* scroll if content is too tall */
}

/* (Optional but useful for visibility while testing) */
header, footer {
  flex-shrink: 0; /* header and footer keep their size */
}
