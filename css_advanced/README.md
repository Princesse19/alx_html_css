# ALX HTML Advanced Project: Nursery School Website

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced HTML and CSS project for creating a **Nursery School website**. The main focus is on **CSS styling, responsive design, and visual layout**. The website includes:

- A homepage (`index.html`) with structured content inside `<header>`, `<main>` (with `<article>` and `<aside>`), and `<footer>`.
- A separate tweets page (`tweets.html`) that embeds social media content.
- Advanced styling using **Flexbox**, colors, backgrounds, borders, hover effects, and a logo.
- Responsive web design for smartphones using the `works_on_smartphone` class and viewport settings.

## Project Objectives

1. **HTML Structure**  
   - Correct use of semantic HTML tags: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`.  
   - Organized content for accessibility and readability.  

2. **CSS Styling**  
   - Base CSS (`base.css`) for consistent fonts, colors, and resets.  
   - Custom CSS (`styles.css`) for layout, positioning, and visual enhancements.  
   - Task 1: Flexbox positioning for layout (`body` column, `main` row, article 2/3 width, aside 1/3 width).  
   - Task 3: Additional styling for header, article, aside, footer, and logo.  

3. **Responsive Design**  
   - `class="works_on_smartphone"` added to `<body>` to degrade layout nicely on small screens.  
   - `<meta name="viewport">` for proper rendering on mobile devices.  

4. **Visual Enhancements**  
   - Added a Unicode logo in the header.  
   - Colors, borders, and hover effects applied without breaking Flexbox layout.
